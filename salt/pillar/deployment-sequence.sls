    # NOTE the order of these is important, because for example
    # IPA will fail to install if Gitlab is running and using port 80,
    # even bound with a different IP - since IPA attempts to bind using 0.0.0.0 (with httpd)
    # at instalation time.

    # nexus container is first deployed by the infra server setup script
    # but is updated by this deployment

    # dovecot is deployed before ipa master so that /etc/skel has a Maildir prior
    # to preconfigured user account homedir creation
